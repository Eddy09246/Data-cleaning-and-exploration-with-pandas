## This provides a basic overview of the data cleaning and exploratory analysis performed on the "salaries_by_college_major.csv" dataset. This is a relatively simple dataset, allowing for straightforward cleaning and analysis.  More complex datasets, with larger volumes of data, inconsistencies, or missing values, would require more sophisticated data manipulation and cleaning techniques, possibly including techniques like imputation, outlier handling, and more advanced feature engineering based on the specific analysis goals.


## Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning steps outlined here demonstrate a fundamental approach to handling missing data and preparing the dataset for further analysis:

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:** The script begins by loading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.  Initial exploration involves checking the shape of the dataset, examining the column names, and displaying the first few rows (head), last few rows (tail), and a random sample.


2. **Missing Value Handling:**  The code identifies and addresses missing values (NaN).  A crucial step is confirming the presence of missing values and then identifying the columns where they exist.  In this case, rows containing NaN values are dropped.  For more complex datasets, imputation or other more nuanced techniques may be necessary to avoid data loss.

3. **Feature Engineering:** A new column "Spread" is created to represent the difference between the 90th percentile and 10th percentile mid-career salaries. This feature helps in identifying majors with lower salary variance.

4. **Sorting and Ranking:** The dataset is sorted to identify majors with the lowest salary spread (low risk) and the highest 90th percentile mid-career salary (highest potential).

5. **Grouping and Aggregation:**  Data is grouped by a category ("Group" column, assumed to exist in your dataset – please update if not) and the mean for each numerical column is calculated.  

## Limitations and Considerations for Complex Datasets

This example offers a simplified data cleaning and exploration process.  For larger and more complex datasets, there are several other factors to consider:

- **Advanced Missing Value Imputation:** Instead of dropping rows with missing values,  sophisticated imputation techniques (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbor, mean imputation ) can be applied to fill in missing values with reasonable estimates, preserving more data.

- **Outlier Detection and Handling:**  Complex datasets often contain outliers – data points significantly different from others. Advanced techniques like boxplots, or interquartile range (IQR) can be used to detect outliers, which may be corrected or removed based on domain knowledge.

- **Data Consistency:** In complex datasets, data inconsistencies might be present (e.g., different date formats, typos,data type).  Careful cleaning and validation for such issues would be required.
